*** 模块分类
加载模块，CPAN上有许多模块可以完成。下面是这些模块的对比，以及各种情况下的推荐模块。

*** 模块推荐
Given the range of features described, there's obviously not one size to fit all, so here are some thoughts on what to use where and when:

- If you want to defer loading of a module until you use one of its functions, go for autouse.
- If you want to defer loading of a class until you try and instantiate it, go for Class::Autouse.
- For lazy loading and lazy instantiation, Class::LazyLoad has a cleaner interface than Object::Trampoline.
- If you want to import an external function, and you don't mind which of multiple implementations on CPAN you use, try Devel::UseAnyFunc. You'll need to think about what you declare as your dependencies though.
- If you want to provide a single interface, with pure perl and XS implementations behind, Module::Implementation is the module for you.
- If you want to use other modules with long names, then aliased might be helpful. If the modules are within your namespace, then relative may be a better fit.
- If you want to find and load plugin modules, it's a toss-up between Module::Find, which offers more flexibility, and Mojo::Loader, which has a cleaner interface, but will only find modules where the .pm file is immediately within the namespace specified.
- When specifying your base classes, if you want to specify a minimum version, use the new superclass. Otherwise, until superclass is in the core, you might as well go with parent.
- If your dist has a lot of subordinate modules, then relative may be useful.
- If you want runtime loading of a module, I'd look at Module::Runtime first, but Class::Load and Module::Load are contenders. Module::Runtime has no dependencies, Module::Load has 6 ultimate dependencies, and Class::Load has 21 dependencies, one of which is Module::Runtime.
